## Lab Description

In this lab, you'll get hands-on with the AI Toolkit (AITK) and Microsoft Foundry in VS Code to explore and compare the latest multimodal and reasoning models from the Model Catalog. Learn how to augment models for a real-world business scenario, using prompt and context engineering. Prototype an agent using the AITK Agent Builder, and equip the agent with the right tools via MCP.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, learners will be able to:

-  Explore and compare models to select the best fit for their business scenario
-  Augment models with prompts and data to get more accurate and grounded responses 
-  Prototype an agent by combining models and instructions with tools via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
